# The implementation of Alphuzz++
We implement this prototype of our approach on top of AFL++ 3.14a. 

**Changes for data structure.** 

We changed the queue structure of AFL++ into a tree structure. Specifically, we construct a seed mutation tree during fuzzing process based on the mutation relationships among seeds. For example, if Alphuzz mutates seed A and generates a new seed B. If seed B is an interesting input, we add it to the tree as a child node of A.

**Changes for seed scheduling strategy.** 

We propose a new seed scheduling strategy based on the MCTS algorithm. First, starting from the root node, we label the currently selected node as the anchor node. Then, we calculate 𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑_𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 for every child node of the anchor node. Then, we recursively select the child node with the highest 𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑_𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 as the new anchor node until a leaf node is reached. 
**Algorithm 1** shows the detailed process of seed scheduling.

We leverage the UCT algorithm to calculate the score of seed. **Formula 1** shows the calculation of 𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑_𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒.

# Installation instructions

The installation is the same as AFL++.

Compile the program with:
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev automake git flex bison libglib2.0-dev libpixman-1-dev python3-setuptools
# try to install llvm 11 and install the distro default if that fails
sudo apt-get install -y lld-11 llvm-11 llvm-11-dev clang-11 || sudo apt-get install -y lld llvm llvm-dev clang 
sudo apt-get install -y gcc-$(gcc --version|head -n1|sed 's/.* //'|sed 's/\..*//')-plugin-dev libstdc++-$(gcc --version|head -n1|sed 's/.* //'|sed 's/\..*//')-dev
cd Alphuzzplusplus
make distrib
sudo make install
```
It is recommended to install the newest available gcc, clang and llvm-dev
possible in your distribution!

Note that "make distrib" also builds instrumentation, qemu_mode, unicorn_mode and
more. If you just want plain afl++ then do "make all", however compiling and
using at least instrumentation is highly recommended for much better results -
hence in this case

# Fuzzing binaries


The fuzzing process itself is carried out by the afl-fuzz utility. This program
requires a read-only directory with initial test cases, a separate place to
store its findings, plus a path to the binary to test.

For target binaries that accept input directly from stdin, the usual syntax is:
```bash
$ ./afl-fuzz -i testcase_dir -o findings_dir /path/to/program [...params...]
```
For programs that take input from a file, use '@@' to mark the location in
the target's command line where the input file name should be placed. The
fuzzer will substitute this for you:
```bash
$ ./afl-fuzz -i testcase_dir -o findings_dir /path/to/program @@
```

You can also use the -f option to have the mutated data written to a specific
file. This is useful if the program expects a particular file extension or so.

Non-instrumented binaries can be fuzzed in the QEMU mode (add -Q in the command
line) or in a traditional, blind-fuzzer mode (specify -n).

You can use -t and -m to override the default timeout and memory limit for the
executed process; rare examples of targets that may need these settings touched
include compilers and video decoders.

Tips for optimizing fuzzing performance are discussed in perf_tips.txt.

Note that afl-fuzz starts by performing an array of deterministic fuzzing
steps, which can take several days, but tend to produce neat test cases. If you
want quick & dirty results right away - akin to zzuf and other traditional
fuzzers - add the -d option to the command line.
